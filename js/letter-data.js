I absolutely love spending time with you and I believe you are genuinely amazing. What's more, I think, in fact I know, you are funny, smart, caring, kind, passionate, witty and most of all beautiful!",

        "Hopefully, by the time you receive this letter we will have already organised to see eachother again soon. However, if not, I would like to invite you a guided tour of your choosing on the 30th September. You can reply by sending a letter back to me at the address below, or by texting me.",

If I siad it as many times as I thought it, our chats would be purely streams of my continued excitement. Here I have managed to limit myself to only two sentences. An achievement! It sometimes helps to think of activities I cannot wait to do with you: three peaks, karting, park run, climbing, travelling, camping, chess, escape rooms, movie marathons, talking, relaxing, sleeping and of course endless more tour guides! :)",
